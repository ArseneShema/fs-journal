# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? 


- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? N/A

- What are you struggling with? This whole week was confusing to me.

- What would you count as a victory? This week went well due to the fact I was able to push thru despite me not knowing what I was doing.
